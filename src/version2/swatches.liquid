  <h2>CSS (Sass) Color palette</h2>
  <div class="cp-grid">
    <div class="cp-widget cp-grid-col-full">
      <p>Colors on this page are distributed using the 60/30/10 ratio and divided into three categories: primary, secondary, and accent. To provide variety, these categories are further used to generate different tints and shades.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="cp-widget cp-grid-col-full">
      <div id="swatches"></div>
    </div>
    <div><span class="cp-grid-label">Primary Color</span></div>
    <div class="cp-widget">
      <p>The body background of this page takes the primary color which covers nearly the 60% of the total UI.</p>
    </div>
    <div><span class="cp-grid-label">Secondary Color</span></div>
    <div class="cp-widget">
      <p>A sample paragraph demonstrating the default body text color. Anything that doesn't carry or inherit any text color style will be shown in this color by default.</p>
    </div>
    <div><span class="cp-grid-label">Accent Color</span></div>
    <div class="cp-widget">
      <p>The accent color constitutes about 10% of small but vital details of a UI based on the 60/30/10 rule. <a href="#">Hyperlinks</a> are the most common example where accent is used.</p>
    </div>
    <div><span class="cp-grid-label">Kitchen Sink</span></div>
    <div class="cp-widget">
      <p>Our sweet and simple, regular paragraph element that adopts the secondary color by default.</p>
      <p class="fade-1">A text fragment with a lighter tone of the secondary color. It is generated by using the same hue as the secondary color but adjusting saturation and lightness.</p>
      <p class="cp-box">A highlighted box-like element that uses variations of the primary color as its background and border.</p>
      <p class="cp-box cp-box--dark">Another box element themed using variations of the secondary color.</p>
